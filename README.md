# My portfolio

This portfolio shows some of my works that I am very proud of. The design is based on colored papers layed on each other.

I used React for this project not because of the state usage, but because of its modularity. I can easily change the interface through its component.
Together with React, the styling is more on SCSS compiled to CSS and a bit of Material-UI for the contact page.
